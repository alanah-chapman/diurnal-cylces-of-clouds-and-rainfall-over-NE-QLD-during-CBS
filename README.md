# Diurnal cycles of cloud and rainfall over North–East Queensland during the coral bleaching season
This repository contains code I have written for my masters thesis "Diurnal Cycles of Clouds and Precipitation During the Coral Bleaching Season". The code accesses the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's level 2 radar datasets, BARRA-R2 regional reanalysis and level 1 Himawari-8 atmospheric and cloud products, all of which can be found on NCI.

`Paper_figures` contains the code for producing each figure submitted for peer review.
`Zhao_etal_inprep` contains the code for producing figures for a separate paper submitted for peer review.
