# Diurnal Cycles of Clouds and Precipitation During the Coral Bleaching Season
This repository contains code I have written for my masters thesis "Diurnal Cycles of Clouds and Precipitation During the Coral Bleaching Season". The code accesses the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's level 2 radar datasets, BARRA-R2 regional reanalysis and level 1 Himawari-8 atmospheric and cloud products, all of which can be found on NCI.

The code in this notebook is organised as such:
(dataset- if multiple separated by -)_(main content)

Dataset codes:

BA = BARRA-2 regional reanalysis

H8 = Channel 13 Himawari-8 brightness temperature

RA = Radar 

RE = Reef location text file

ST = BoM weather stations

TO = Australian bathymetry dataset (topography)
